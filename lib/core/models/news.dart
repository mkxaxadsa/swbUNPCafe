        'Ibai, London EC1: ‘A swanky restaurant that lacks any pomposity’ – restaurant review',
    body:
        'Despite being one of the loveliest parts of London, the area around St Paul’s Cathedral is not especially known for eating out. Winding lanes, cobbled streets, ancient history standing side-by-side with spanking new architecture … And now Ibai, a short walk from Little Britain, as mentioned in Great Expectations, and next door to the wildly underrated 901-year-old church of St Bartholomew the Great. Tourist-level prettiness: 100%. Actual tourist draw in peak-season August: zero. Not even the pigeons bother lingering around here.\n\nSpecialising in Basque cuisine and serving from noon until 10pm Monday to Friday, Ibai is a brooding, gothically dramatic jewel of an 80-seat restaurant. It is capacious, as a former warehouse tends to be, with rich oak colours, crisp, white tablecloths and several vast, convivial booths for group dining. It’s sort-of industrial, sort-of fancy pirate ship and definitely striking, a mood helped very much by the fact that our Spanish server had a resplendent Salvador Dalí moustache and took our orders in the manner of Terry Gilliam in Monty Python’s Spanish Inquisition. If the food had turned out to be atrocious, I’d still go back to Ibai, because I developed a massive soft spot for the place even before I’d finished my first drink.\n\nIbai seems to have positioned itself as a Basque-influenced steak restaurant that specialises in Galician blond rib, which for non-steak readers is a VIP cow that’s reared in a very particular way and for much longer than your typical cattle. Any steak aficionados who adore Lurra or Donostia, both co-founded by Ibai’s Nemanja Borjanović, will be aware of Txuleta, his renowned Galician meat supplier and its complex, highly textured, high-fat beef.\n\nYet to focus purely on those fancy steaks would, I feel, misrepresent Ibai as a macho joint designed mainly for finance bros to stuff their faces with beef while swilling back old-world reds. You could, in fact, eat here without so much as touching a steak, or even meat, because it has a complex, fully formed menu of Basque and French ideas, featuring octopus, turbot, king crab and red prawns, or carabineros. If you’re feeling flush, order those prawns raw in a neat tartare, topped perhaps with some optional Oscietra caviar. The octopus is a rich, smolky spin on marmitako, a Basque tuna stew, mated with pipérade, a traditional pepper and onion stew, and the result is a dark red pot of tentacles, alliums and yielding sweet peppers in a sauce that’s made to be scooped up with baguette.\n\nIn fact, some of the strongest, most unusual dishes on Ibai’s entire menu are to be found in its starters section. It would be easy, for example, to overlook “tender sweetcorn with black truffle”, thinking it all sounds a bit healthy, but it turns out to be a buttery, truffley Galician chowder that will live long in the memory. The beef tartare is uniquely, well, bright red, made vivid by espelette pepper. There’s also a “croque Ibai” sandwich, which is not for the meek, with boudin noir, melted tomme de brebis cheese and a layer of those aforementioned carabineros.\n\nFor vegetarians, meanwhile, there is charred cauliflower with Ossau-Iraty cheese, hazelnuts and parsley, perhaps with a side of braised leeks with mustard. For non-vegetarians, however, it would be remiss not to try at least some of the beef, be it black angus “by Miguel Vergara from Castile and Leon”, Galician blond “by Xose Portas in Pontevedra” or full-blood wagyu from Norfolk, all cooked under the watchful eye of Richard Foster, former head chef at Chiltern Firehouse.\n\nIbai is certainly a swanky restaurant, but it lacks any pomposity. The staff arent tugging their forelocks or raising an eyebrow at an elbow on the table. It’s a serious restaurant with fairly serious prices that doesn’t expect you to take life seriously. There’s very little on offer that’s picky-uppy, although if you’re dining lightly at one of the counter seats, there is a plate of noir de bigorre ham with crisps to nibble on over a glass of something red, maybe alongside some paté Basque with truffle honey.The pudding list, if the steaks don’t end you, is worth the trip alone. For one thing, there is my ultimate death-row dessert, the lesser-spotted pain perdu, here served with hazelnuts and rum, as well as a creamy, slightly wobbly gateau Basque with summer berries. Don’t write Ibai off as a steakhouse for city boys; it’s much, much more than that. This hulking Basque pleasure palace signals that opulence and living it large are very much still “in”.',

        'The London & Paris, Folkestone, Kent: ‘Numerous devil-may-care twists’ – restaurant review',
    body:
        'Folkestone flies a bit under the radar as a recently spruced-up seaside dining destination. The likes of Deal and Margate get all the attention of the down-from-Londons yet, ironically, the London & Paris hotel and dining room, near the town’s harbour arm, has been a magnet to fops from the capital since at least 1854. Victorians en route to France dined on this quaint corner, then slept over before braving the boat to Boulogne.\n\nA hundred and seventy years later, on entering this rather cool seafood restaurant, there’s a real sense of history in its quaint, wilfully eccentric dining room, boasting bold wallpaper, original tiled floors and mismatched dining chairs, but the design is so clever that even they somehow all complement each other. The owners have restored some parts of the building and kookily revamped others, but the overall effect is of a building that’s definitely loved again.\n\nI haven’t a clue what the saloon bar fayre here was like in the mid-19th century, but current chef James Pearce, formerly of nearby Rocksalt, sets out to celebrate the best of Kent’s fishy and shell-bound produce. There’s plenty of choice on an à la carte menu that opens with Blackwater Estuary oysters – served natural, dill-pickled or deep-fried with a mackerel panko crumb, XO and yuzu – before moving on to a gamut of “snacks” to go with their natural-leaning wine list, including smoked cod’s roe with seaweed crackers and scallop roe, and cockles and whelks in chilli and garlic oil. Over in the mains, there’s monkfish with white miso or cod in vodka batter.\n\nAn innocent bystander might read this menu’s nonstop maritime madness, complete with numerous devil-may-care twists, and think it’s a bit frightening. Up close, however, it’s all rather charming: modern cooking served on antique tables from which you look out on a seafront that’s as old as time. There’s also a daily-changing blackboard of meat specials – on the day we visited, that included a fancy surf’n’turf sirloin steak with prawns and salsa verde and pork chop with pink fir potatoes. There was even a plain old house burger, which I found admirable: serious cooks don’t often offer burgers, because otherwise their customers will just bloody order it and completely ignore the menu’s fancier offerings of chilli razor clams and butterflied mackerel with a green herb potato salad.\n\nAll that said, on a Friday lunchtime in mid-August, the London & Paris was deserted save for two other guests, which was a shame, because not only was the à la carte really rather exciting, but there was also a long, lovely, fishy specials board, too, featuring fresh whitebait, dressed crab, coal-roasted lobster and sumptuous spins on sea bass, plaice and turbot. Mind you, Folkestone in general seemed a bit deserted on this peak-season day, too. Perhaps that’s the tragedy of all these reimagined, aspiring-to-coolness coastal towns – there’s just not enough weekday footfall.\n\nWe shared a fantastic bowl of kombu-crumbed calamari with fermented hot sauce, followed by excellent beetroot-cured salmon dotted with roast beetroot jam and coal-roasted, shell-on langoustines with a punchy, garlicky salsa verde. We shared a whole roast bream, all glossily brown-skinned and perfectly judged, with new potatoes. The vodka batter on the fish and chips was non-negotiably boozy, and I’m not sure it worked all that well, but the cod itself was a whopping great thick chunk and came with slender-cut fries and a pretty ramekin of, ahem, pea puree. Spiced monkfish was delightful, as was its accompanying silky miso sauce spooned over pak choi, salsify and unshelled smoked mussels: true comfort food. Roast hispi cabbage in a miso sauce was the only concession to vegetarians, incidentally.\n\nThe London & Paris is one of the best restaurants operating along this stretch of coastline – aside from, of course, my beloved Folkestone Wine Company. The menu makes a concerted effort at every turn to pack in extra interest, flavour or pizzazz, and while some of it may not quite land, most of it does.\n\nA rich dark chocolate mousse for pudding was airy, yet densely packed with flavour; heartbreakingly, among that lunchtime’s four-strong clientele, we were the mousse’s only fans. Folkestone may never be as talked up as somewhere to escape the rat race in the same way as, say, Whitstable and Hove are, but here on a corner of the town’s harbour, the London & Paris has a long history of feeding those passing through on a day trip or to catch a ferry, who enjoy the view and the food, then leave, maybe never to return. It’s a formula that has worked for 170 years, so there’s no point in changing things too much now.',

        'Cornus, London SW1: ‘Big prices, nice tablecloths, no riff-raff’ – restaurant review',
    body:
        'The act of opening a restaurant, being severely detrimental to both bank balance and mental health, should be done only sparingly over a lifetime. A fortnight ago, the team behind Medlar, a well-established, 15-year-old Chelsea fine dining spot, opened a sister restaurant, Cornus, in Belgravia. That seems to me an eminently sensible age gap, not least because the road to hospitality ruin is paved with overly keen expansion that leads to everything being spread far too thinly, be that the front of house or the praline cream.\n\nAt Cornus, however, there is already a real sense of judicious growth in just about every aspect of this particular rollout. First, the location: Eccleston Yards is a genteel, prettily kept courtyard of shops about seven minutes’ walk from Victoria station. Leave the traffic and the hubbub behind, and slip down an alleyway into a former power station that’s been neatly coiffed, cobbled and filled with a Hotpod Yoga studio, a cryotherapy treatment boutique and a bespoke iced biscuit emporium. If that all sounds rather frivolous and not at all rooted in “the real world”, then I’ll remind you that this is Belgravia and the residents here rarely sully themselves with common reality.\n\nCornus is in the far corner of the yard, down a marble passageway, and has its own elevator to take you up to the top floor, where it lives in all its white, starched tablecloth majesty – 70 seats in an L-shaped room with honey fabrics and floor-to-ceiling windows draped with ivory netting. The staff are lovely, smiley and very amiable, although the place itself is a somewhat serious restaurant.\n\nThe menu, meanwhile, is seriously grounded in the principles of French cooking – executive chef Gary Foulkes has worked at high-end joints such as The Square and Angler. Begin with dainty starters of handpicked Devon crab with a smattering of hass avocado, wasabi and finger lime, or a warm salad of artichokes, crispy quail’s eggs, summer beans and black Australian truffle. Move on to mains of roast Newlyn cod with persillade of Scottish girolles, grilled cuttlefish and Alsace bacon; or southdown lamb, romero pepper piperade, lamb kofte, fried capers and olives. Both of those main courses dance around the £45 mark, so the prices here are serious, too. So serious, in fact, that a tomato salad, a small portion of spaghetti with lobster and a slice of lemon tart will set you back about £80 before you’ve even glanced at the wine list; there is a complimentary gougère and good focaccia from the bread basket, though.\n\nObviously, I am majorly underselling those three dishes. That tomato salad is made with Hubert Lacoste’s exceptional and rare heirloom tomatoes from Gers in south-western France. Monsieur Lacoste, I hear, is terrifically picky about when his tomatoes are allowed to leave his farm – so much so that only on his say-so, and not a moment before, can Foulkes even consider adorning them with goat’s curd, dressing them in cherry juice and tweezering fig leaves on top. Hubert’s tomatoes cost £20, although in the interests of transparency I paid less than that, because I visited when Cornus had only just opened.\n\nThe £38 lobster spaghetti consists of delicate, hand-rolled pasta, native lobster, Amalfi lemon and a small scoop of oscietra caviar. Yes, the price is steep, but then hand-rolled spaghetti in Belgravia has never come cheap. The Amalfi lemon tart with greek yoghurt ice-cream may well be £17.50, but it’s made by Kelly Cullen, one of the UK’s brightest new names in desserts, and Cornus has cleverly snapped her up as its pastry chef, much to my chagrin because beforehand she was at Allegra, one of my locals in east London. Here, her raspberry millefeuille with lemon verbena cream and baked raspberry ice-cream is one of the highlights of the entire Cornus menu.\n\nThis is not a raucous place to dance on tables or to look for all-day brunch, or indeed to leave stuffed to the gills. It’s a modern, yet defiantly old-school restaurant where you can speak, be heard and be well looked after. It isn’t trying to be youthful or on-trend, it’s just celebrating exquisite products cooked by a talented team working at a level that only a handful of people in Britain today could even hope to manage. When I visited, most of the clientele seemed to be Medlar regulars, happily ensconced in their new lunch venue, nibbling quails’ eggs and chocolate barquette. Big prices, nice tablecloths, no riff-raff: to your average Belgravian punter, that is as good as it gets.',

        'Galleria: ‘Leeds in full weird-and-wonderful mode’ – restaurant review',
    body:
        'Galleria is an all-day restaurant tacked on to the side of Project House, a new (or at least new-ish) arts venue not far from Leeds city centre. People who don’t know Leeds or what it’s like – let’s, for the sake of argument, call them southerners – often imagine it to be a rough-and-ready place full of brash Yorkshire pragmatists who have absolutely no time for pretentiousness. Well, they’re wrong. Leeds has always been chock-full of some of Britain’s greatest dandies, dreamers and creative crackpots. I blame the university, the Industrial Revolution and something in the drinking water from the Royd Moor Reservoir.\n\nProject House, a collaboration between several local artistic groups – Brudenell Social Club, Belgrave Music Hall, the Welcome skate store and Super Friendz – is a 1,000-person-capacity venue with a restaurant attached, and a great example of Leeds in full weird-and-wonderful mode. Go for the “equilibrium retreat”, the rave bingo, the all-day desi festival and the “bring your own brood” mass yoga sessions, and stay for a whole wood-fired chicken with confit garlic, home fries, butterhead lettuce and dip, all cooked by chef Andy Castle, previously of Ox Club, a grill restaurant 10 minutes up the road.\n\nGalleria’s menu, it has to be said, is much, much more enticing than your average arts centre cafe-bar’s – there’s not a limp slice of quiche or a thawed-out coffee and walnut cake in sight. Stale, mass-produced scones and dry ciabatta in fancy galleries are among my ultimate first world bêtes noires. At Galleria, however, the menu reads incredibly well even before a bite or slurp has been taken: three-cheese croque madame on wood-fired flatbread, southern fried bream with a kohlrabi and fenugreek remoulade, hash brown stuffed with sugar pit bacon and, on the drinks menu, smoked bloody marys.\n\nFluffy, salty, judiciously charred flatbreads come with a variety of toppings: mortadella, smoked pineapple, mustard and jalapeño; pulled lamb’s leg with kalamata olives, black garlic and mint; or tomato, crispy chilli butter and wild oregano. These flatbreads, like all great art, take a lot of time and love to create, beginning life at least 42 hours before they’re eaten – first as a biga, an Italian pre-ferment – which is then combined with malt and water before it goes through an arduous proving process. It’s then divided into small bundles of joy, grilled over fire and served with something drizzly, something scoopable and something crunchy.\n\nForgive me for all the detail, but Galleria’s flatbreads are truly intoxicating – they are essentially the daily bread that I spent every morning at methodist primary school asking God to give us. I ate one with whole barbecued purple carrots, blackened further by the flames and arranged like a goat’s horns, while the flatbread came dappled with scorch marks to the point of leopardprint, before being given a smear of silky, fresh hummus and a scattering of a crunchy, fiery, yet at the same time delicate take on bombay mix. When it arrived, I stared at it agog, not wanting to ruin its sheer beauty with my greed. The dish is vegan, but I defy any meat-eater to argue that it would be improved by the addition of a pork chop. A dish of Turkish eggs, ’nduja butter, whipped goat’s curd and hot honey was similarly gorgeous, and came with yoghurt, the warm, buttery, paprika notes of aleppo chilli and another of those warm, soft flatbreads to scoop through the drippy poached egg yolks that merged with the cool, balm-like garlic yoghurt sauce.\n\nGalleria’s menus from breakfast through to dinner cherrypick lovely, snacky things from around the world – from France, Greece, the USA, Asia, north Africa – but what unites them is Castle’s thoughtful, complex, fresh approach.\n\nIt’s far from the cosiest restaurant you’ll ever go to – by daytime, it’s a rather starkly pale, casual space, and it’s by no means a dress-up-in-your-Sunday-best place – but then, it never claimed to be. At the same time, however, this is not a coffee spot next to a yoga hall that does eggs and posh pizza.\n\nEven if you did just pop by Galleria for a cake and a cup of Yorkshire tea, the sweet things on offer are all freshly made, and very nicely, too. We ate an incredible zesty key lime pie and a big chunk of pecan pie topped with whole nuts, both of which featured a thick, buttery pastry base.\n\nLeeds may still be as eccentric as ever, but it now has an arts venue cafe that’s way more appetising than 90% of the places in our so-called capital city.',

        'OshPaz, London W1: ‘Who doesn’t love a dumpling?’ – restaurant review',
    body:
        'Just off Piccadilly Circus, on Regent Street, two very different restaurants now sit within a few metres of each other. One is a new-ish all-day Uzbek street food joint OshPaz, where manty and plov are served by ladies in cute, traditional embroidered hats. The other, close by, is a branch of Pizza Hut. One early afternoon in late July, when the world and its grandmother needed lunch after going to see Eros, guess which one had a queue snaking out of the door and which one did not? Yes, clearly the former was Pizza Hut, with its £13.99 a head unlimited “buffet” bundle, complete with access to the “ice-cream factory” with freeflowing Mr Whippy and bubblegum sauce. OshPaz, by comparison, was delightfully underpopulated: walk-ins welcome, solo diners treasured. Bliss.\n\nThat’s not by any means a dig at any one who chooses to “hit the Hut” – pizza has its place, after all, especially if you need to feed the kids – but it’s also a reminder that Uzbek cuisine is not at all mainstream. This landlocked Central Asian country has 35 million inhabitants and a worldwide diaspora, but few people in the UK know much about lag-man, samsy pastries and cream-drenched manty. The latter’s lack of wider popularity is especially bewildering, because, well, who doesn’t love a dumpling? OshPaz’s manty have thin, wobbly skins holding beef, chicken or pumpkin seasoned with cumin and coriander. They’re wrapped into delicate, pretty, plump packages and steamed for 40 or so minutes, until they’re ready to serve with carrot salad, soured cream and, if you like, chilli oil.\n\nI can’t vouch for the authenticity or otherwise of dipping an Uzbek manty into Japanese-style chilli oil, but there you go – these manty are, roughly speaking, Middle Eastern koftas inside Chinese xiaolongbao dough. That said, and in a bid to prevent an international incident, I’ll stop blurring precious foodstuffs now. Neither, heaven forbid, will I take a guess at who influenced who here. What I will say, though, is that if you ever fancy losing three glorious hours of life, you could do a lot worse than spend them researching Uzbek plov, in which long-grain white rice merges with chicken or lamb, onion, carrot, raisins, paprika, whole garlic heads and perhaps a few chillies. Let’s avoid a pan-global bunfight over the minutiae of Indian pilau, Pakistani pulao, Afghan pilaf and so on. Which is better? Who ripped off whom? And at what point on the Silk Road circa AD138 did some bright spark first simmer rice with meat and think, “We’re on to a winner here”?\n\nBetter, I think, simply to visit OshPaz, pull up a chair or a stool at the counter, order the lamb plov (or the chicken or vegan variety) with fresh achichiq chuchuk (tomato and cucumber salad) and minted soured cream. Sip from a pot of milky masala tea flavoured with honey, cinnamon and ginger, and keep a cool, clear head.\n\nTry the manty, too, and the samsy – buttery, flaky puff pastry enveloping cumin-spiced lamb. Yes, you might find yourself wondering where the samsy ends and the samosa starts, and where the Caribbean patty and the Cornish pasty enter the game. But I don’t have a dog in this fight, merely the appetite of a famished great dane, which comes in handy if you also order the chicken lag-man, or fried noodles in a spicy broth, which are, to my mind, the stars of the show here. The advertised “broth” is nothing of the sort, though. Rather, it is a thick, hearty stew with chunks of pepper, celery, onion and some chilli.\n\nOshPaz is small – I’m calling it a restaurant only due to the smart, uniformed table service, but in truth it’s more a cafe that also does takeaway. Owner Muzaffar Sadykov has worked tirelessly since 2009, when he turned up in the UK, initially to study IT before making it his life’s mission to teach us the joy of Uzbek cooking. He started with various street food stalls and pop-ups across London, then moved on to more semi-permanent bases at Seven Dials Market in Covent Garden and Mercato Metropolitano in Borough. Now he has rocked up here with a bricks-and-mortar site in London’s West End, where he’s not only competing with Pizza Hut, but also St James’ rather more glitzy esablishments.\n\nYes, the menu is brief – some rice, some noodles, some steamed dumplings and some baked ones – but service is quick and there’s a vegan option for everything. There are no desserts, no limitless candy sprinkles and no buffet with a chicken and sweetcorn pizza congealing under a heat lamp, but what OshPaz does have is huge heart. It may take me a moment to find Uzbekistan on a map, but Piccadilly Circus? Well, even a fool can get there.',

        'Tollington’s, London N4: ‘Hands down the greatest chips I’ve ever eaten’ – restaurant review',
    body:
        'Some restaurant folk have a habit of opening restaurants I’d recommend to nobody. They know who they are. Those huge, hulking, fancy openings, always but always adorned with huge, imported chandeliers and calfskin banquettes. Pretty to look at, and they’ll give you a table for eight for Susan’s birthday and serve you pumpkin ravioli, but also guarantee you a soulless, lacklustre experience.\n\nAnd then you have the likes of Tollington’s. This culinary conundrum of a place is a new fish joint in Finsbury Park, north London, that’s run by people who couldn’t do any of the aforementioned tedious, showy blandness if their livelihoods depended on it.\n\nMind you, I’m inclined to steer you away from Tollington’s, too, though for different, entirely selfish reasons. Much as I did with the same team’s earlier venture, the Plimsoll, an impudently shabby, utterly wonderful old boozer a mile down the road. Tollington’s, you see, lives inside an old-school 1970s fish-and-chip shop, even though the space has apparently had a re-style. Whatever they’ve done to the place, however, it’s clearly had only the lightest of rejigs. Comfy it ain’t. Chandeliers: zero. The stainless-steel chippy counter – an artefact handed down from a previous Tollington’s incarnation – is still in full use. Glass cabinets brim with good stuff. And chef/co-owner Ed McIlroy serves up grilled john dory, sardines from the plancha, and devilled crab and cod cheeks through a gap in the counter where chips were once wrapped.\n\nSo, would I send you here? Well, yes, but with caveats. This tiny, wonky, Finsbury Park-meets-San Sebastián pintxo bar is already plenty hectic enough with customers embracing its hell-bent peculiarity. They love that the seating is just a few tables in a back room, with a shelf running the length of one wall. There, a throng of folk tuck into beauvale cheese with quince on hunks of bread and drink vermouth, fino or Estrella on tap (or Vichy Catalan mineral water for those who are driving), all while standing up and tumbling out on to the pavement outside.\n\nThese tiny touches of the Costa del Islington signify so much. The Tollington’s boys themselves have never claimed that this is a pintxo joint of the sort that you might stumble across in northern Spain – but if you know, you know. It’s there in the casually slung but excellent produce, in the plates of Basque chistorra sausage fried with tomato, and in the abrasive pickled anchovies doused with good oil; it’s also there in the fat, dumpy, deep-fried balls of fine devilled crab. And it’s all served in a setting that screams of its own culinary history. A thousand British restaurateurs have died trying to harness the magic of a hake, flan and txakolí joint in Donostia old town, before ending up in a whirlwind of crap meatballs with garlic bread tapas and tables for nine.\n\nIn other words, call Tollington’s a pinxto bar in much the same way as you’d feed a unicorn sugar lumps: do so discreetly or it might run away. Tollington’s has also earned the spurious honour of giving me without doubt the greatest chips I’ve ever eaten. Hands down the best. No quibbles. Rarely have I wanted to embrace a chef, but these chips are emotional. I shall talk of these chips on my deathbed – these hot, fresh, fat, crisp chips fried in beef dripping and served with a heroic dollop of homemade allioli and a mild, sweet, silky bravas sauce. These are chips that defy sharing. They have all the punch of a 1970s trip to Scarborough with Ferran Adrià in charge of the ketchup.\n\nThat said, Tollington’s menu, other than a ripe tomato salad and a truly great green salad with soft-boiled egg, is mainly fish: raw bream with flat peaches or grilled sardines with blackened skins and whacked on to plates. Cod cheeks come with that delightful stewed red pepper mush the Spanish do so well, monkfish comes in a complex sauce of capers and raisins, and smoked eel features in a light, fragrant tortilla. For meat lovers, there is pork neck with plums and onions or beef with fresh melon. Dessert-wise, there is just a flan – one of those obscene, wobbly, creamy, custardy ones with a honey-brown top and swimming in a caramel pool of sticky loveliness. This is some of the best cooking in London right now.\n\nMy big fear is that the Tollington’s boys will eventually cave in and open a proper fancy place, complete with tablecloths, varnished floors and all, inside something as pedestrian as a real restaurant. Yes, that would be a huge win for anyone hoping to eat McIlroy’s food in comfort, but for now, while he and his team are entirely off the leash, this unruly bunch are the British food world’s biggest trailblazers.',

        'Albert’s Schloss, London W1: ‘A stroke of genius’ – restaurant review',
    body:
        'The Bavarian mini-chain Albert’s Schloss has finally reached London, where it has opened a 600-cover pleasure palace. The very thought will probably shake earnest foodie readers to their core. Albert’s Schloss, you see, is all about fun: noisy, determined, oom-pah-pah fun. It is also about wall-to-wall schnitzel, strudel and currywurst. Eat bacon kroissant royale from 9am and schweinshaxe on a Sunday. There’s a live house band from 4-7pm every night, followed by a nightly “Kunst Cabaret” with singalong piano, dancing ladies, DJs and, of course, more oom-pah-pah. So much endless oom-pah-pah, in fact, that never will one’s oom be so triumphantly pah-pahed. No tickets required and, says the website, everyone welcome.\n\n“No thank you, Mr Schloss,” you might well be thinking while sliding under the bed. “Please keep your Weimar Republic-themed booze stampede away from me. It sounds noisy and prone to spillages.” Even so, most people I’ve met who have visited one of the other Albert’s Schlosses in Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham have fond, albeit woozy memories of late nights and perhaps a little too much Erdinger Weissbier, Stiegl-Goldbräu or Früli beer. They talk of booze, spätzle and fried goods covered in melted Alpine cheese, taken at long benches while sitting next to strangers who only recently became best mates. Nobody ever woke up and thanked God that they’d discovered the rhubarb and custard sour or the quietly lethal and bright blue show bunny, because both of these drinks require you to line your stomach first, perhaps with one of Albert’s Schloss’s giant pretzels with sweet mustard and pickles. The jalapeño pretzel is the best: a hunk of warm, spicy carbs with a variety of dippy things that’s hard not to love.\n\nAnd here’s the thing: the food at Albert’s Schloss is really much, much better than it needs to be, especially this close to Leicester Square. I popped in for a weekday lunch at 1pm and stayed for three hours, dining in a cosy, magnificently camp, fake Bavarian cable car. At some time during dessert – a very good, stacked chocolate cheesecake with raspberry coulis, incidentally – a man in a singlet climbed up on stage, said, “2,2,2”, into a mic and played Mustang Sally. It was 4pm on a Thursday, and the cabaret had opened.\n\nWe’d toyed with the idea of ordering the fondue with extra bratwurst, but instead went for cordon bleu schnitzel, which had gruyère and prosciutto under its breadcrumb coat and came with wild mushroom and brandy sauce and truffle fries. If that sounds a bit bloody much, it absolutely was. The side of sformato – truffled cheese mash – was rib-stickingly decadent, too. The biggest surprise, however, was the schweinshaxe pork knuckle laden with a huge, crisp piece of crackling. The meat was seasoned with juniper, caraway, fennel and black pepper, and it was served with red cabbage, apple sauce and gravy.\n\nI had imagined that the food here would be like a Bavarian-themed Wetherspoon, where the ping of the microwave delivered cheap, cheerful stodge. Instead, there’s a meaningful drive here to establish Albert’s Schloss as a proper all-day restaurant, with an intriguing, thoughtful and playful menu where Berliner shawarma salad sits happily alongside chickpea fattoush, salt beef reuben and vegan wurst.\n\nHowever, it’s the “everyone welcome”, “endlessly open” and “usually something happening” that’s the special sauce at Albert’s Schloss. Isn’t that music to the ears of anyone planning a small group trip to London? No booking required, no credit card deposit, no dress code, no time slot. London is difficult for the outsider: expensive, exclusive and impenetrable. Everything is happening everywhere, apparently – but it’s just not for the likes of you … well, unless you like waxworks. Building an Albert’s Schloss just off Leicester Square, where a tourist cannot help but trip over it, is a stroke of genius. Bring them your hopeless, bedraggled hen nights, your travelling college football teams and everyone else hoping to enjoy “swinging London” and grimly considering a Shakespearean hip-hop walking tour.\n\nAlbert’s Schloss will save these people from a night of queueing for M&M World. It is a deeply silly point of refuge, an oasis, a cold pint of Pilsner Urquell and a woman in a sparkly bra singing a Liza Minnelli medley. It’s not cool, it’s not going to appear in any lofty, food scene guidebooks, but it’s clean, welcoming, and has friendly staff and nonstop giant pretzels. I had more fun here than I’ve had at many a Michelin-starred restaurant. And that’s quite wunderbar.',

        'The Counter, Tunbridge Wells, Kent: ‘It treats my inner Veruca Salt with pure imagination’ – restaurant review',
    body:
        'Off to the Counter, a new restaurant in Royal Tunbridge Wells, Britain’s most civilised, leafy postcode. This is the land of the white-linen-trousered lady of leisure, striding along the Pantiles, brunching at the Ivy, then heading off for a tootle around Fenwick followed by coffee at Basil, an independent cafe that serves the UK’s best brownies. My imaginary life as a better, glossier, more gentrified Tunbridge Wells woman would feature all of the above, perhaps even with a dachshund in my armpit, seeing as that seems obligatory round here, along with a car strewn with hair and hay.\n\nThe Counter by Robin Read recently entered this glorious fray with a tasting menu-only restaurant in an elegant, modernist, navy blue space. Gosh, this is a gorgeous room: rustic floorboards, high ceilings painted black, spotlights, peculiar art, fine cutlery and informal yet sleek, kind service. “Tasting menu-only?”, I hear you whimper. Is this one of those places where the chef keeps you hostage for hours and feeds you only small, tarted-up plates of their imagination, all hewn in heritage parsnip and hawthorn sap?\n\nWell, yes. Yes, it is. But if anyone is going to enforce a tasting menu on me, I’d like it to be Robin Read. His culinary journey has been irrefutably impressive, starting off with the Roux brothers, moving on to a stint with Nico Ladenis, and then one with Marco Pierre White at Mirabelle, with time at Le Gavroche and the Square in the mix, too. If anyone knows about tweezering tiny shards of loveliness on to crockery at a pleasing pace, and leaving you full rather than fractious, it is Read.\n\nHere at the Counter, there is a five- or eight-course option, plus a 10-course one if you perch at the kitchen counter within touching distance of the man himself. Otherwise, you can just sit at a table, which are beautifully spaced apart, and talk openly without being heard. Read, rather obviously, wants to centre his menus around the best seasonal, local produce, and to maximise all his ingredients to minimise waste. So, if you see the words “malted sourdough with waste vegetable broth” on his menu, please be aware that the tiny mug of aromatic siltiness that turns up with the hunks of fresh bread is very much as it claims: waste veg, stewed. Read says this is only “good housekeeping”, and I’m certainly not going to argue.\n\nThe eight-course menu began with a small chalk stream trout tart, slightly bigger than an amuse-bouche and laden with beetroot and bronze fennel. Then, after the “waste broth”, some balm-like ricotta with freshly podded broad beans and peas, as well as notes of kohlrabi and nocellara olive. Read clearly loves to experiment with vegetables, fusing ideas that are not often experienced. All of these initial courses were, in fact, generous; in a “normal” fancy place, the ricotta, for example, would have been egg-cup-sized, but here you get a sense that Read’s insistence on serving only tasting menus comes from a place of practicality. You will be fed heartily and, by doing it this way, less goes into the bin.\n\nSmall, plump jersey royals arrive in a slick of watercress veloute dotted with smoked eel. It is pond-green, stinky and very tasty. Seaweed-baked john dory comes on a spring vegetable pot au feu with local guanciale and lovage. The main event was roast saddle of Sussex lamb, still quite rare, with ribbons of courgette arranged in a pretty rainbow, an aubergine sauce and a rich, oregano-spiked jus gras.\n\nIt’s hard to fault anything about the Counter, because this is precise, accomplished cooking that feeds you classily but plentifully, then aims to finish you off entirely with the dessert courses. I am an absolute sucker for the end of any tasting menu that bombards the guest with sweetness. First there was a rich blackberry sorbet with an oxbow lake of fig oil, then an exquisite creme fraiche parfait with a glazed, nutty, linseed biscuit topping, all bedecked with gooseberry compote and elderflower gel and, finally, a set of boxes called “the sweet treat tower” containing soft fresh fudge, caneles and chocolates. I am heavily pro such moments at the end of clever, slightly worthy dinners, when the kitchen suddenly reveals its inner Willy Wonka and starts treating the Veruca Salt in all of us with pure imagination. The Counter is delicious and charming, and my love for Tunbridge Wells remains unbridled.',

        'Panda’s Kitchen, London: ‘It demands your full attention’ – restaurant review',
    body:
        'We all find comfort in different places. A few months ago I received an email from a reader who had been tending to his ailing dad at Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow, where I grew up. One evening, having spent the day bedside, he needed dinner, and found his way to Panda’s Kitchen, a Sichuan restaurant down on that stretch of Harrow’s Station Road that has long been a little Chinatown, in among the Gujarati cafés and Middle Eastern grill houses. He clearly found something diverting amid the tension and emotional chaos of parenting his parent.\n\nI related to this. My parents’ home was not far from Northwick Park Hospital. Both of them spent time there and one of them made a good stab at dying there. (My mother was even a non-executive director of the hospital whose intensive care unit she occupied for a while.) Anybody who has reached that age where looking after their parents, even just temporarily, is a part of life’s narrative, will know the irregular rhythm of it. We hope for something smooth. We hope for something sweet and painless; we don’t always get it. Tossed about on the roaring oceans of stomach-churning drama we swim desperately in search of still waters. Meal times become more than just fuel. If you don’t feed yourself, you’re no good to anyone else so they have a certain utility and imperative. But they are also a reminder of normality, of a time before the call came summoning you to the bedside. And all of that really is comforting.\n\nIn theory, the kind of food offered by Panda’s Kitchen should not be considered comforting. We are old hands at the Sichuan repertoire now, aren’t we? We know about the explosions of chillies and the deep, salty, fiery broths; the oil baths the colour of a sunset’s ends and the peppercorns that make your lips and tongue tingle, like your name has been spoken in a whisper in a next-door room. If anything, it should be considered discomfort food. But a bowl of something which is so powerful and so intricately layered that it demands your full attention can sometimes be exactly the comfort we need.\n\nIt helps that, while the restaurant is a featureless oblong room, Panda’s Kitchen is also a deep imperial red, with red banquettes and hanging basket lanterns. That gives it a womb-like feel. Do not, however, come for a fancy time. Panda’s Kitchen does not do fancy. The tables are wipe-down. The laminated menus are wipe-down. If you ask for the aloe vera or the sour plum juice from the soft drinks list, they’ll plonk down a plastic bottle. You get to crack the seal yourself. Ask, and they’ll bring you a glass with ice.\n\nAll the familiar Sichuan dishes are here. I have to order the black cloud ear fungus salad. The soft, slippery, frilly lobes of mushroom somehow manage to be both lightly gelatinous and crunchy at the same time. The soy vinegar dressing is invigorating. There is the unrestrained hit of red chilli and the breezy aromatics of coriander. It is both dramatic and refreshing; a reminder that all the flavours are about to be turned up a notch. Another Sichuan classic, gong bao prawns, is equally on point. The seafood is fresh and squeaky; the acidity of the gently thickened sauce, a foil to its sweetness. And when all the prawns have gone there is the meditative process of picking with your chopsticks between the fine dice of celery for the victory of now-slippery peanuts.\n\nDry-fried green beans with minced pork and chilli bring crunch to the table. The menu also includes double-cooked pork, Chongqing chicken and the offer of a hotpot, which is less dinner than a challenge to be completed. Avoid sticking a chilli-dipped finger in your eye, as I once did. These are the familiar orders, but there are other things. Among the starters are Sichuan crispy pork strips, a collection of delightful words that belong together. The meat has been marinated, then battered in a golden overcoat of echoing crunch. With it is a seasoning dust of chilli, ground Sichuan peppercorns and, I suspect, MSG fairy-flavour dust. Lift a crisp pebble. Dip it in the seasoning. Repeat. Sea bass and catfish are offered many ways, both whole and in fillets: “red braised” or “dry slow cooked”; with pickled cabbage and chilli or ginger and spring onion. We have fillets first deep fried in the lightest of batters, then turned in a sauce of Sichuan chilli bean paste until almost dry, so that the sauce seems to be inside the batter.\n\nThere are also the dishes on the small “seasonal” menu, although it’s not clear which season they have in mind for these are wintery stews and today it is hot and steamy. Then again Chengdu, the Sichuan capital, often is too. A ceramic bowl arrives filled with hunks of red-braised lamb, with equally meaty, curling and crinkled sheets of bean curd and slow-cooked potato. It all bobs in a thick sauce full of soy, chilli heat and sweetness from the lamb. The crumbling potato acts as thickener. You can eat it with rice, but it feels like a complete dish. While it is very much Sichuan, it also shakes hands with things like scouse from Liverpool or Monmouth stew from Wales, those dishes that make a little prized and expensive meat go so much further through the alchemy of seasoning and time.\n\nThe Sichuan Mao roast duck is a quiet showstopper. Bone-in pieces of something similar to Cantonese roast duck bob in a light, chilli-boosted broth full of bean sprouts, handfuls of coriander, dried chillies and so very much more. The once crisped, lacquered skin is now soft and salty. The meat pulls from the bones, which pile up. It’s a soup fighting for main course status, and very much winning. There is a dessert menu, but I suspect the Irish cream cheesecake hasn’t been made on site. As ever with places like this, I leave feeling I haven’t done the menu justice; that the three of us today have only just scratched its imperial red surface. Incidentally, my correspondent’s dad is home now and doing well. His son will have to find another excuse for a fix of thrill-seeker’s comfort food.',
